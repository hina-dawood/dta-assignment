Deliverables
1. Link to GitHub pages of the final product.
https://github.com/hina-dawood/dta-assignment

2. Link to the source on GitHub.
https://github.com/hina-dawood/dta-assignment/tree/master/src

3. How long the exercise took.
7-8 hours

4. Rationale around tech choices.
Some of the tech choices made are: Redux - for maintaining application state; Axios - for Ajax request; Enzyme - javascript testing utility for React; Nock - Http mocking library for test; create-react-app used for quick project configuration

5. Next steps / features missing.
We could have a feature to display changing percentage value during animation.
